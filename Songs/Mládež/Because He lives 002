.   Ami           F
 I believe in the Son
.   Ami           F
 I belive in the risen One
.   Ami           F
 I believe I overcome
.      Ami           G
 by the power of His blood

. F    G Ami
 Amen, amen,
.G    C
 I'm alive, I'm alive
.           G
 because He lives!
. F    G Ami
 Amen, amen,
.G      C          
 let my song join the One
.           G
 that never ends!

.           Ami F C
 Because He lives

 I was dead in the grave
 I was covered in sin and shame
 I heard mercy call my name
 He rolled the stone away!

.           C
 Because He lives,
.           G
 I can face tomorrow!
.           C
 Because He lives,
.              G
 every fear is gone!

.  C       G
 I know He holds
.   C       G
 my life my future
.       F
 in His hands</lyrics>
