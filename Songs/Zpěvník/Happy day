 <lyrics>.C
 The greatest day in history,
.F
 Death is beaten, you have rescued me, 
.Am                       F
 Sing it out, Jesus is alive!

.C
 The empty cross, the empty grave,
.F
 Life eternal, you have won the day,
.Am                    F
 Shout it out, Jesus is alive! 
.G
 He's alive!
 
.C           F           Am
 Oh, happy day, happy day,
.G
 You washed my sin away
.C           F           Am
 Oh, happy day, happy day,
.G
 I'll never be the same
.G
 Forever i am changed
 
.C
 When i stand in that place,
.F
 Free at last, meeting face to face,
.Am                          F
 I am yours, Jesus you are mine.

.C
 Endless joy, perfect peace,
.F
 Earthly pain finally will cease
.Am               F
 Celebrate, Jesus is alive,
.G
 He's alive!
 
.Am                  Em
 Oh, what a glorious day    
.                F
 What a glorious way
.C
 That you have saved me!
.C                   Em
 Oh, what a glorious day
.                 C
 What a glorious name</lyrics>
