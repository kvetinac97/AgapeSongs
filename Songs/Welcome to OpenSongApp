 Welcome to OpenSongApp!
 This is a test page to show you some of the features of the app.
 The app contains 2 modes -

[Get help with all of the cool features...]
 To find out all of the app features and how to use them,
 please check out the online help pages.

 http://www.opensongapp.com
 You can also click on the link icon page button.

[Adding songs]
 You can manually enter/create any song you like
 The app only comes with this &amp;apos;song&amp;apos; by default due to copyright.
 You can also import songs from other services:
;• Desktop OpenSong - I highly recommend syncing using Dropbox
;• OnSong files
;• ChordPro files
;• Ultimate Guitar website (using the import feature)
;• Chordie website (using the import feature)
;• SongSelect .usr files
 Songs are stored in OpenSong format (XML files without the .xml)

 Songs are stored on your device in the /OpenSong/Songs folder.
 This location is found at the storage location you chose
 when you first ran the app.  Check out the &amp;apos;Storage&amp;apos; category
 of the options menu to see where this is.

[Edit the song]
 Click on the song title in the menu bar to see a song preview.
 This also allows you to quickly edit the song

[Chords at work]
 This song has been set as having a key of G.
 You can also set capo display options easily
.G     D      Em           C      G         G7
 Chord lines (above) start with a full stop/period (.)
.C       Em            D      G
 You can transpose the chords easily.
 This is done from the chords category in the options menu
 Nashville, European and Do Ré Mi chords are understood

[Scaling]
 By default OpenSongApp scales a song to fit the page.
 You can change the auto scale options in the right hand menu

[Sets]
 Add songs to sets by long pressing on them in the song menu
 The set icon will pulse to let you know of any changes.

[Customising]
 You can customise colours, themes,fonts, gestures, pedals, etc.
 These customisations can be saved as user profiles.
 Check out the categories in the right hand options menu.



HERE IS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW A SONG WOULD LOOK



[V1]
.G2                D/F#
 Love everlasting, love without measure,
.Em7                 D       
 Full of compassion, righteous and pure;
.C     G/B             Am7   C/D      D
 Is my Saviour&amp;apos;s love, is my Father&amp;apos;s heart.

[V2]
.G2                   D/F#
 Loved by the Father, saved by the Son,
.Em7                 D           
 Born of His Spirit, washed in the blood;
.C          G/B             Am7        C/D      D
 This is my Saviour's love, this is my Father's heart.

[B]
.Em            Cmaj7 Em                Cmaj7

 Loving each other, since Christ first loved us;

 Sharing my Saviour's love, showing my Father's heart.
